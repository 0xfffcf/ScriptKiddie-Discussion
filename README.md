> # Introduction

- **It is now 2022 and I still see so much people asking about how to hack someone, how to steal credit card, etc. Why are people so obsessed with money and harming people. This is just how human works. Well, I am not here to philosophy but to talk how hacking is done in 2022 and what need to change. I am not here to teach you how to hack someone and I discourage it. Hacking should be praticed at home on your own device!**
