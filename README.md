> # Introduction

- It is now **2022 and I still see so much people asking about how to hack someone, how to steal credit card, etc**. Why are people so obsessed with money and harming people. This is just how human works. Well, I am not here to philosophy but here to talk how script kiddie nowadays and what need to change. I am not here to teach you how to hack someone and I discourage it. Hacking should be praticed at home on your own device!

<br/>

> # Script Kiddie in general

- In my own word, a script kiddie is someone who is not willing to learn hacking and just copy/pasting code without knowing what he is doing or asking people to help him hack the others. They are really current on big platform like Discord.

<br/>

> # Danger of Script Kiddie

- **The danger** in script kiddie is that they can get really powerful tools online and we know what they want. They want to cause trouble and with simple malware on github you can hack people fairly easy. I won't say you will hack load of people but it will do the job to ask someone you want to scam or whatever. Stop doing this! It is not the way and you will never get far in the field this way.

<br/>

> # Trolling Script Kiddie

- After all, script kiddie are usually terrible so we will be talking about the word trolling. It is now really common to troll script kiddie. Most of the people nowadays play around with script kiddie and do social engineering to hack them.

<br/>

> # What to change

- If you really want to get into malware develpment, you will need to work. For example, you want to have a perfect body. **Do you really think you will get a perfect body in a week or a year!? Of course, you won't.** It is the same way for hacking/programming. Never give up and keep learning everyday is the way to go!
